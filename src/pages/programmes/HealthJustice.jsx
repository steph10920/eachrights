              <p>
                Article 43(1) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, guarantees
                every person the right to the highest attainable standard of
                health, which includes the right to healthcare services,
                including reproductive healthcare.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite these constitutional guarantees, many people
                continue to experience barriers to accessing quality,
                affordable, accessible, and appropriate healthcare
                services. Vulnerable and marginalized groups and
                communities are often disproportionately affected —
                poverty, geographical isolation, discrimination, limited
                health infrastructure, inadequate information, and unequal
                access to services can prevent people from fully enjoying
                their right to health.
