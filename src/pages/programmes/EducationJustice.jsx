              Education is both a fundamental human right and an essential
              means of realizing other human rights. It enables
              economically and socially marginalized children and adults to
              overcome poverty and participate meaningfully in their
              communities. It also plays an important role in empowering
              women, protecting children from exploitative and hazardous
              labour and sexual exploitation, promoting human rights and
              democracy, protecting the environment, and advancing
              sustainable development.

              The Education Justice Programme therefore seeks to promote
              the right to quality, inclusive, equitable, and accessible
              education for all, with particular attention to vulnerable
              and marginalized groups and communities. The programme
              recognizes that barriers to education are often
              interconnected with poverty, geographical location, gender,
              disability, displacement, insecurity, inadequate
              infrastructure, and other social and economic factors.
